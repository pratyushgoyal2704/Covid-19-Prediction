# Covid-19-Prediction

In this project we try to forecast a time series data. We build and analyse three different models using Python and inspect their results. Our main model used is ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and the other two comparative models are LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Neural Network) and a simple polynomial regression.
